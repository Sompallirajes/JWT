What are JWT uses?


ChatGPT said:
JSON Web Token (JWT) is widely used for authentication and secure data transmission in web applications. Here are its key uses:

1. User Authentication
JWT is commonly used for user authentication in web and mobile apps.

After successful login, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.

The client includes the JWT in subsequent requests (usually in the Authorization header).

The server validates the token to grant access to protected resources.

2. Authorization
JWTs help in role-based access control (RBAC).

Users with different roles (admin, user, editor) receive tokens with specific claims that define their permissions.

3. Single Sign-On (SSO)
JWT allows users to log in once and access multiple applications without re-authentication.

The token can be shared between different services in a distributed system.

4. API Security & Stateless Authentication
APIs use JWT for secure communication between clients and servers.

The server does not need to store session data, as all necessary information is encoded in the token.

5. Microservices Communication
JWT facilitates secure communication between microservices by passing identity claims.

Each microservice can verify the token without depending on a central authentication service.

6. Data Integrity & Secure Transmission
Since JWTs are signed using HMAC or RSA, they ensure data integrity.

Clients and servers can verify that the token has not been altered.

7. Token-Based WebSockets Authentication
JWT can be used to authenticate WebSocket connections for real-time applications.
